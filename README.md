### Blog Application - Steps and Structure

#### 1. **Backend Setup**
   - **Initialize a Node.js project**: Set up a new Node.js project with `Express` for handling server-side routing.
   - **Database Design**: Design the MongoDB schema for users, posts, and comments.
   - **User Authentication**: Implement user signup and login using JWT for token-based authentication.
   - **CRUD Operations**:
     - Create routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
     - Implement similar CRUD operations for comments associated with posts.

#### 2. **Frontend Setup**
   - **React.js Setup**: Create a React app and set up routing using React Router for navigating between different pages.
   - **UI Design**: Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling and building a responsive layout.
   - **State Management**: Use **Recoil.js** for managing global state, such as user authentication status and post data.

#### 3. **Integration**
   - **API Integration**: Connect the frontend with the backend using Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests.
   - **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling both on the frontend and backend.

#### 4. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for backend routes and frontend components.
   - **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the frontend and backend to ensure the entire application works as expected.
